# cryptotax

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, SEVERAL TESTS ARE STILL REQUIRED

french tax declaration generator for various exchange in order to fill 2086 report

* `--inf is input file (etoro report)`
* `--outf is output file (csv report of disposal declaration)`
* `--cc is option for trying close position compaction`
* `--begin is begin date of year of declaration`
* `--end is end date of year of declaration`

example of running:
* run compose file for mariadb service (tune file if needed, beware of 3307 port)
* create virtualenv (dev is made with python 3.6)  
* install requirements (pip)  
* run main script
 
`python src/main.py --inf etoro_account_statement.xlsx --outf report.csv --cc --begin 2020-01-01-00-00-00 --end 2020-12-31-23-59-59`

If problems, try locate failing step in main.py and tune directly in database (i'll add some check/auto-repair/fix features later...)

### CURRENT DEV (branch: develop):

    * traduire ce readme en fran√ßais parce que c'est con en anglais en fait....
    * test more with various inputs
    * little refactoring on disposal calculus
    * add real config file
    * switch coingecko to binance for price guessing when binance active
    * add command step process support
    * finalize binance implementation
    * support mixing exchange declaration
    * add "instant 0" / "balance 0" validation (avoid selling asset created ex-nihilo....)
    * add replay/idempotency support
    * add correct rounding

### CURRENT LIMITATION

    * no support for interexchange/wallet movement (ex: buy on coinbase, send to binance then sell)  

### NEXT: 

    * add coinbase implementation
    * add cryptoco implementation
    * add sqlite support (no need for external db with compose)
        * i don't like it because it makes debug/profiling harder for me
        * but it is easier to handle for not-dev people...


### Exchange inforamtions:
* for 2086 filling, we only need crypto asset, legacy stocks are filtered if any (like ETORO)
